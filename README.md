# Inventory Management System - Frontend

## Description
The Inventory Management System project is a web application built with Vue.js 3, Vuex, SCSS, Jest, and TypeScript. It serves as a user interface for managing inventory data stored in a [backend](https://github.com/danielreboucas/inventory-management-backend) API developed with Nest.js. This system enables users to perform various inventory management tasks efficiently, such as adding, editing and deleting products, as well as tracking inventory movements.

## Features
- Data Consumption: Integrates with a backend API built with Nest.js to fetch and manipulate inventory data securely.
- User Interface: Provides a responsive and intuitive user interface for performing inventory management tasks, designed with Vue.js 3 and SCSS to ensure a modern and visually appealing experience.
- Login: Implements a login feature using JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure authorization and authentication, ensuring only authenticated users can access and manipulate inventory data.
- Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes, allowing users to access the application from desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Testing: (TODO) Implements unit tests with Jest and TypeScript to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application's functionalities.
- Dashboard: (TODO) Plan to add a dashboard feature for visualizing product inventory, sales data, and profits. This dashboard will provide users with insightful visualizations and analytics to help them make informed decisions about their inventory management strategies.

## Technologies Used
- Vue.js: Front-end JavaScript framework for building reactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- Vuex: State management pattern and library for Vue.js applications, used to manage application-level state in a centralized store.
- SCSS: Preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to enhance the styling capabilities of the application.
- Jest: JavaScript testing framework for writing and running unit tests, ensuring the correctness of the application's functionalities.
- Typescript: Strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- Axios: HTTP client for making API requests and handling responses asynchronously.
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes.
